# PharmacyFinder

This gem prompts the user for a zip code, and returns a list of the closest location of 3 different retail pharmacy/drugstores (in the US only).
The user can then select a location to get more information about it, such as distance, hours, and address.

To appreciate, please suspend some sensible concerns: 
	* people don't live at zipcodes, they live at addresses
	* Walgreen's is not on the list because it's store finder website is wicked hard for me to scrape.
	* In some zip codes, the closes one or two locations may belong to the same chain of drustores, and this list would not tell you about those.
